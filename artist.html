      <strong>In Sync</strong> is a collaborative showcase of creativity and experience. 
      We are a group of Multimedia Arts students whose distinct talents—ranging from 
      cinematography, photography, and graphic design—come together in rhythm. 
      Each piece in this exhibit is born from our shared journey as artists, 
      reflecting the harmony we’ve found through different mediums and perspectives.

        <h2>Aimee Ang-Ug</h2>
        <p>
          As a multimedia artist specializing in cinematography, I capture emotions through movement, 
          light, and rhythm. My film <em>Huni</em> represents my passion for visual storytelling, 
          translating feelings into stories that connect with people.

        <h2>Ian Saromines</h2>
        <p>
          I specialize in photography—freezing time through a lens to express silent emotions. 
          Each frame I capture is a reflection of perspective and patience, 
          finding stories in small, everyday moments.

        <h2>Jugi Tabada</h2>
        <p>
          I specialize in graphic design. For me, design is both structure and emotion— 
          a balance of clarity and creativity. I aim to communicate ideas that not only look 
          appealing but also connect meaningfully with people.
